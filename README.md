# BL3 Read-Only Toggle

### Purpose

This set of scripts adds a right-click action to `.sav` (Borderlands Save Files) to toggle read-only. They do both the *Read-Only* flag, as well as properly revoke the right permissions (the new requirement for BL3).

### Installation
*Theoretically*, installation is as easy as downloading the `.zip` file, extracting it, and running `install.bat` as an administrator, and following Windows prompts - this should copy files to `C:\Users\YourUsername\BL3 Read-Only Toggle` and run the Registry Edit file. If it does not work correctly you can do these steps manually as well.

### Problems?
I did just throw this together in a total of an hour or two, so it's highly likely this does not always install correctly/errors. If you do encounter any of these please make issues.

### Disclaimer
As said in *Problems?* above, I put this together in a couple hours, so it is plausible that the script fails - so please make sure you test it before you start completing quests/ruining your progress. Also I'm obviously not responsible if the file somehow doesn't toggle to read-only and you accidentally progress your save file, crash something, cause thermonuclear war, etc.
